DESCRIPTION = """
Backend for provider pre-authorisation requests: case intake, validation, rule evaluation, advisory
recommendations, human review, and an immutable audit trail.

**The system never issues final authorisations or denials.** Only an authorised human reviewer can move a case
to `APPROVED` or `DENIED`.

**Authentication assumption:** requests arrive through a gateway that authenticates the caller and sets
`X-Actor-Type`, `X-Actor-Id`, and (for reviewers) `X-Actor-Roles`. When the service is exposed on a public URL
without such a gateway, set `PREAUTH_GATEWAY_SECRET`; every `/api/v1` route except the voice channel then also
requires a matching `X-Gateway-Secret` header. Voice-channel routes authenticate separately (bearer token for
tool calls, HMAC signature for the post-call webhook).

Every response carries `X-Request-ID`. Errors use a uniform envelope: `{"error": {"code", "message", "details",
"request_id", "case_id"}}`.
