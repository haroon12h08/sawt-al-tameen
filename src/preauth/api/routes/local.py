"""Transport for the local voice channel. Thin: parse, call one runtime method, return its payload.

These routes exist only when the process runs with ``PREAUTH_RUNTIME_MODE=local``; otherwise the router is not
mounted at all. They carry no insurance logic — the runtime they delegate to reaches the same application
services through the same agent toolbox as the ElevenLabs channel.
