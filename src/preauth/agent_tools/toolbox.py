"""Voice-agent tool boundary.

The agent operates the system through exactly three tools:

    verify_caller        identify the calling organisation and, where relevant, the member
    check_coverage_rule  check a complete request against the benefit schedule
    log_transcript       record what the caller was told, and raise a callback where a human must follow up

**There is no tool that approves, denies, or finalises anything.** That is an architectural fact, not a prompt
instruction: recording a decision is a reviewer-only API that the voice actor has no credentials for. Tool inputs
are flat (strings, integers, enums) with a description on every field, because voice platforms accept only simple
parameter schemas and the model needs guidance for each value it fills in.
