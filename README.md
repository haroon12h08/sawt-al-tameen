## ١ ⋄ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐬 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 · القاعدة

An automated line must never tell a clinic that treatment is approved or denied. Here that is not an instruction
the model could be talked out of. It is how the software is built:

- The agent has **three tools**, and none of them can approve, deny or finalise anything.
- Recording a decision is a **reviewer-only API**, and the voice agent has no credentials for it.
- The case state machine lets only a `HUMAN_REVIEWER` move a case to `APPROVED` or `DENIED`, and refuses to load
  if that table is ever edited otherwise.
- A case a call has touched **cannot be signed off until the call transcript is on record**.
- A human decision never overwrites the system's recommendation. Both are kept, append-only.

Ask the agent to approve something and it declines, every time, because there is nothing there for it to call.

| | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Identify** | Clinic, broker or supplier? Suppliers and patients are routed away from the pre-authorisation flow. |
| **Verify** | Provider number, then policy number and date of birth. A lapsed policy stops here. |
| **Collect** | Procedure code, estimated cost in AED and treatment date, each read back digit by digit. |
| **Check** | Tier limits, co-payments, network nesting, waiting periods, documents and thresholds. |
| **Answer** | A prepared recommendation, a list of missing documents, or an escalation that cites the exact rule. |
| **Log** | The call is recorded and the references are read back. From here, a human takes over. |

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `verify_caller` | Identifies the organisation and the member; returns the tier and dependants, or why verification failed |
| `check_coverage_rule` | Checks a complete request; prepares a recommendation or escalates, citing the rule |
| `log_transcript` | Records what the caller was told, and raises a callback when a human must follow up |

`check_coverage_rule` refuses to run without a verification from `verify_caller`, so no caller gets a coverage
answer before they have been identified.

[`knowledge_base/`](knowledge_base/README.md) is the single source of truth. The rules engine decides from it and
the agent retrieves the same files. When the agent cites *"Section 4.14 of the Executive Schedule of Benefits"*,
that section really exists in a document the agent can quote.

| Tier | Annual limit | Network | Pre-auth threshold | Outpatient co-pay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Basic | AED 150,000 | Basic Network | AED 1,000 | 20% |
| Enhanced | AED 500,000 | Enhanced Network | AED 2,500 | 20% |
| Comprehensive | AED 1,000,000 | Comprehensive Network | AED 5,000 | 10% |
| Executive | AED 3,000,000 | Executive Network (worldwide ex-USA) | AED 10,000 | 0% |

Networks nest, Basic ⊂ Enhanced ⊂ Comprehensive ⊂ Executive, and only Executive covers out-of-network care. The
catalogue also holds **50 procedures** (36 clear, 11 ambiguous, 3 excluded), **20 providers** across three
emirates and **20 members** (three of them lapsed). Where the rules stop, one of **eight escalation rules**
hands the case to a person, and the escalation quotes that rule's own words:

| | Hands the case to a person when | | Hands the case to a person when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESC-001` | required documents are missing | `ESC-005` | the procedure is unscheduled or new technology |
| `ESC-002` | two policy clauses conflict | `ESC-006` | clinical and cosmetic intent are unclear |
| `ESC-003` | a limit or sub-limit is exceeded | `ESC-007` | eligibility is in doubt |
| `ESC-004` | diagnosis or procedure coding is disputed | `ESC-008` | the provider is suspended, onboarding or out of network |

Requires Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Docker is optional; it is only needed for PostgreSQL.

**The backend on its own:**

```bash
uv sync --extra postgres
uv run alembic upgrade head                  # create the schema
uv run python -m preauth.seed --scenarios    # load the catalogue and five demo cases
uv run uvicorn preauth.main:app --reload     # http://localhost:8000/docs
uv run python scripts/simulate_conversations.py   # five complete calls, with transcripts and assertions
```

**Fully local: free and offline.** The LLM runs on Ollama, speech-to-text on faster-whisper and text-to-speech on
Piper. The same three tools, rules and review queue sit underneath.

```bash
uv sync --extra local --extra local-voice
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
uv run python -m piper.download_voices en_GB-alba-medium --data-dir ./models/piper
./scripts/check_local.sh      # names anything missing, with the command that fixes it
./scripts/run_local.sh        # takes the first free port from 8000; open /local in a browser
uv run python -m preauth.local_cli   # the same agent in a terminal, no audio needed
```

**Hosted, with ElevenLabs.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in the hosted section, then run one command:

```bash
./scripts/run_hosted.sh
```

It starts the backend and a tunnel with a fixed public URL (ngrok, whose free static domain needs no domain
purchase, or a Cloudflare named tunnel). Next it runs all 28 deployment checks through that URL and stops if any
fail. Then it builds the agent (tools, knowledge base, prompt, Arabic preset, keyterms and μ-law audio) and
registers the post-call webhook. Finally it prints the browser test-call link. A second run changes nothing
that is already correct.

## ٦ ⋄ 𝐏𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐬 · الهاتف

Calls come in on **your own Twilio number**; the number is not imported into ElevenLabs. Twilio posts each call to
the backend, which checks Twilio's signature, registers the call with the agent through ElevenLabs'
`register-call` API, and returns the TwiML that connects them. The one Twilio setting:

> Phone Numbers → Active numbers → *your number* → Voice Configuration → **A call comes in**: Webhook,
> `https://<public URL>/api/v1/voice/twilio/inbound`, HTTP **POST**

The endpoint stays switched off until `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, and it never accepts an unsigned request. If
ElevenLabs cannot be reached, the caller hears a short apology rather than a dead line. Details, including the
μ-law audio requirement: [DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#a-real-phone-number-your-own-twilio-number-via-register-call).

```bash
uv run pytest                                             # SQLite
docker compose up -d --wait                               # PostgreSQL
PREAUTH_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://preauth:preauth@localhost:55432/preauth uv run pytest
```

**307 tests**, passing on both databases. They build the schema through the real Alembic migration, so the
migration itself is tested. Among other things, they pin down that:
- all three lapsed members are rejected;
- all eleven ambiguous procedures escalate, citing their own rule;
- missing information is never reported as a failure;
- no rule result can be changed after the fact;
- a forged Twilio signature is refused;
- no agent, hosted or local, can reach a tool that decides anything.

No test needs a model download or a network connection.

| Command | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `scripts/verify_deployment.py` | A live deployment behaves correctly end to end (28 checks) |
| `scripts/simulate_conversations.py` | Five call shapes, including a caller demanding a decision (30 checks) |
| `scripts/generate_uae_knowledge_base.py --check` | The catalogue is internally consistent |
| `scripts/check_local.sh` | What local mode still needs on this machine |

After changing routes, schemas or the catalogue, regenerate the derived files:
`uv run python scripts/export_api_docs.py` and `uv run python scripts/generate_uae_knowledge_base.py`.

Sawt Assurance is an invented insurer. Every member, provider, policy number, licence number and tariff is
synthetic, and procedure codes use a deliberately fictional `SP-#####` scheme rather than CPT. The structure
follows UAE health-insurance practice, so the rules behave believably: DHA and DOH mandated cover, tiered
networks, co-payments, pre-authorisation thresholds, waiting periods. **None of it is real policy, and none of
it may be used for a real authorisation decision.**
