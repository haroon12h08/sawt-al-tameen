# Voice agent (ElevenLabs)

How the ElevenLabs agent connects to this backend, what the setup script configures, and what you configure in the
dashboard.

## Identity and terminology

The agent is the in-house pre-authorisation line for **Sawt Assurance**, a fictional UAE insurer. It administers
pre-authorisation itself rather than through a third-party administrator, and says so if asked, so there is one
consistent story on the call.

Terminology follows UAE practice (see the research notes in the project report):

- **Pre-authorisation / prior authorisation** for the request; **authorisation reference** is avoided in favour of
  the concrete case reference the tools return.
- **Turnaround:** elective outpatient within six working hours, elective inpatient within 24 hours, emergencies
  immediately with written confirmation within 24 hours. These mirror the DHA claims directive in force in 2026.
- **Document channels:** the provider portal, or **eClaimLink** (Dubai) and **Shafafiya** (Abu Dhabi).
- **Emirates ID** is the identifier UAE providers normally use for eligibility; this line verifies with the policy
  number plus date of birth, and the member records carry an Emirates ID for future use.
- "Letter of guarantee" / "LOG" is **not** used: research did not confirm it as standard UAE insurer usage, so the
  agent says "case reference" instead of risking a wrong term.

## How the guardrails are enforced

1. **No decision tool exists.** Three tools, none of which approves, denies or finalises
   (`tests/integration/test_agent_tools.py`).
2. **Verification gates coverage.** `check_coverage_rule` requires a `verification_id` from a successful
   `verify_caller`, so a greeting-stage or unverified call cannot obtain a coverage answer.
3. **Escalations cite a rule.** Ambiguous cases return the ESC-### rule from `knowledge_base/escalation_rules.json`
   with its text, not a generic "needs review".
4. **Sources are real.** Coverage answers cite the tier's schedule and section, which exist as documents in the
   agent's knowledge base.
5. **Transcripts precede sign-off.** A case touched by a call cannot be decided until its transcript is stored.

## 1. Run the setup script

Prerequisite: the backend is running on a public HTTPS URL with `PREAUTH_VOICE_AGENT_TOKEN` set (see
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)), and the catalogue loaded (`python -m preauth.seed`).

```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...            # ElevenLabs → Developers → API keys
export PREAUTH_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.example
export PREAUTH_VOICE_AGENT_TOKEN=...     # the same value the backend uses

uv run python scripts/elevenlabs_setup.py --dry-run   # inspect what will be sent
uv run python scripts/elevenlabs_setup.py
```

It creates or updates, in one run:

- a workspace secret holding `Bearer <token>`;
- the three webhook tools, with schemas generated from the backend's own input models;
- the knowledge base: every file in `knowledge_base/` (tiers, procedures, providers, members, onboarding, the four
  per-tier schedules, and the escalation rules);
- the agent: system prompt from `voice/system_prompt.md`, English default with an Arabic preset and Arabic first
  message, `end_call` and `language_detection` system tools, Eleven v3 conversational TTS, and 100 speech
  keyterms (procedure codes, tier and network names, provider numbers, identifier prefixes).

IDs are kept in `.elevenlabs-state.json`, so re-running updates in place. Options: `--llm`, `--tts-model`
(use `eleven_flash_v2_5` if v3 conversational is unavailable on your plan) and `--voice-id`.

> The script follows the ElevenLabs API reference as of September 2026 but has not been run against a live account
> from this repository. If a request is rejected it prints ElevenLabs' error body; the dashboard steps below are
> the fallback.

## 2. Dashboard configuration

### Post-call webhook (required before any sign-off)

1. Workspace settings → Webhooks → create an HMAC webhook pointing at
   `https://<your-backend>/api/v1/voice/elevenlabs/post-call`.
2. Copy the signing secret into `PREAUTH_ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and restart the backend.
3. In the agent's post-call webhook setting, select it and enable transcription events.

Without this, reviewers get `CALL_RECORD_PENDING` on every case the agent touched. That is deliberate.

### Workflow and per-node tool scoping

Build this in Agent → Workflow. The greeting node has no access to `check_coverage_rule`, which is also enforced in
the backend by the verification requirement.

| Node | Purpose | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Greeting & triage | Identify caller type; detect language | `language_detection` |
| Verification | Organisation, provider number, member policy and date of birth | `verify_caller` |
| Request intake | Collect procedure, cost, date; read back for confirmation | none |
| Rules check | Check the request; explain documents or escalation | `check_coverage_rule` |
| Close & log | Record the outcome, read back references | `log_transcript`, `end_call` |
| Human handoff | Supplier, complaint, unsupported language, repeated failure | `log_transcript`, `end_call` |

Edges: greeting → verification for clinics and brokers; greeting → human handoff for suppliers, patients and
out-of-scope calls; verification → request intake only when `authorised` is true, otherwise → human handoff; rules
check → close & log in all cases.

### Languages, LLM fallback and analysis

- English is the default; Arabic is configured as a language preset. Keep language detection enabled.
- Enable a backup model (LLM cascading) so a primary-model timeout does not drop a live call.
- Evaluation criteria to add under Analysis:
  - `no_decision_given` — never said or implied approved/denied, never disclosed an internal recommendation outcome.
  - `identifiers_confirmed` — read back the policy number, procedure code, amount and date before checking.
  - `verification_before_policy_detail` — discussed no policy detail before `verify_caller` returned authorised.
  - `correct_routing` — complete requests prepared for sign-off; ambiguous ones escalated with a reason.
  - `reference_given` — caller received the case reference or call reference.
- Data collection: `case_reference`, `call_reference`, `caller_role`, `call_language`, `procedure_code`.

### Agent tests

`voice/agent_tests.json` holds five ready-made definitions matching the scenarios the backend already proves:
high-stakes refusal, clean approval recommendation, ambiguous escalation, lapsed member, and an Arabic supplier
onboarding call. Each lists expected and forbidden tool calls. Create them under Agent → Tests and run each several
times for a pass rate.

### Voice

`--voice-id` defaults to a neutral, professional Voice Library voice rather than a consumer-warm one. Before
finalising, preview it in your workspace on a spoken policy number and an SP-code sequence
("P-O-L dash S-A dash 2026 dash 100001", "S-P-2-0-0-4-0") and confirm the digits are crisp. That check needs your
account; it cannot be done from this repository.

## 3. Talk to it

- **Browser (free):** `https://elevenlabs.io/app/talk-to?agent_id=<agent_id>`, printed by the setup script.
- **Phone:** see [DEPLOYMENT.md → Phone numbers](DEPLOYMENT.md#phone-numbers-what-is-and-isnt-free).
